# Game-Knight
Welcome to Game Knight!

Game Knight is a way to better organize and manage your board game collections,
as well as find more info about games you might be interested in! You can share and compare collections with friends, keep track of house rules,
and much more to come in the near future!

The technologies used to build this app consisted of a React, Javascript frontend with a Django, Django REST Framework, Python backend.
For styling I used mostly CSS with minimal help from the Mantine library. And for all my board game information needs I used the Board Game Atlas public API.

In order to run my project you can either, go to the live site which is deployed on heroku via "https://game-knight-183e3f967a99.herokuapp.com/" ,
or you can Clone this Git repository and install the dependencies which are located in a requirements.txt file by using either "npm install" or "pip install".
You can then run the server locally by using "npm rundev" on the frontend, and "python manage.py runserver" on the backend.
